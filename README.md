While developing PickedMail - The personal AI Inbox, we need to support user login to multiple Google accounts simultaneously. However, Google iOS SDK only allow user to sign in to one account at a time. As a result, we developed a framework to allow user to sign and maintain connection status to multiple Google account. We open sourced this framework to help others who are struggling through the same problem
